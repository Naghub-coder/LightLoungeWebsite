          </span> &nbsp; What are Sensor based lights? When to choose them?
          <br>

            There are 2 types of sensors , PIR sensor and Microwave sensors. Of course there are a few more types of sensors , The most often used are the above mentioned sensors. 

PIR or  Passive infra red sensor detects the change in the warmth of the human body while moving , whereas the microwave sensor detects the position of the human or an object and measures the time taken by the object by the reflection of the microwave signal

So when a sensor is connected with a light in a circuit , the light is lit up when the sensor  senses a movement of a person or an object . For a pre - determined period of time ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes , the sensors will enable the light to glow when there is a motion being sensed. In the absence of motion the sensor switches off the light , saving on power.

These are best used in offices where the lights will turn off in case there is no human motion or presence in a room..In conference rooms and bathrooms which are used lesser compared to other rooms , it would be prudent to install a sensor so that the lights turn off when the rooms are not in use and save energy.

For residential applications , sensor lights would make more sense in parking areas , garden areas and all outdoor areas .
