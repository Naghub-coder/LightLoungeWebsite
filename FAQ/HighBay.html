          </span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What are Highbay Lights?<br>
          <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Any indoor spaces which are very large needs a different type of light. Typically spaces like warehouses , indoor sports arena , have their ceilings or trusses at a greater heights than other  commercial spaces. The minimum heights  start  around 6  metres ( approximately 18 feet) and go upto heights of 12 metres and  above in rare cases. This scenario requires lights of greater brightness to drive the light from that heights to the floor below. Lux determination in these cases become extremely important because of a singular reason. As the heights are very high , the light fittings can be fixed only by scaffolding or by using special lifts. So lux calculation would be a wiser decision than be deciding a product based on the price.

            It is prudent to remember that once a light has been fixed and if the lux is not sufficient after production or work starts , it would be a daunting task to remove the lights and fix again.
            
            As the fixing and removal of lights is a huge task , it is highly important that the Highbay light is very robust and sturdy. 
            
            There are many Philips Highbay lights with starting brightness of 10000 lumens to 24000 lumens. Highbay lights wattages start from 80 watts to 200 watts. Often the indoor spaces require a very large number of lights and also throw up a sizeable power bill. 
            
            To have a better ROI on the Power Bills , there are options like fixing dimmable highbay lights or connect motion sensors to the  lights. These can be done based on the application of use
