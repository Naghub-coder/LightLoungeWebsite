          </span> &nbsp;What is Multiple Color based lighting? When is it required to install?
          <br>
          <span style="font-size: 1rem;">
            
           
            Since last few years , multi color lighting is catching the fancy of the customers which are  Also known as color changing lights . 

            There are 2 options to this 
<br>

1.	RGB lights , which are Red green and Blue lights. Chiefly they are strip lights , where the three colors glow in their own color frequency and when any 2 or all three are lit up will give a different hue to the room.
<br>
2.	Smart Color Lighting . All major lighting brands today deal with smart color lighting which are multi color lighting which can be operated by wifi or blue tooth.
<br>

Color lighting is as it suggests very colourful and the varying shades of blues , greens , reds and their combinations , looks very good and pleasing.

Nevertheless, multi color lighting is not best recommended for the routine functional tasks. Color lighting is best suitable  for relaxation , get togethers or for parties. It is best to have a combination of functional lights and color lights.
