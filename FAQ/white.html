          </span> &nbsp;When to use 4000 k natural white ? Is this better than warm white or Cool white ?
          <br>
          <span style="font-size: 1rem;">
            
           
            Let us start with what is Kelvin, which is a measurement of temperature in the International standard of units. Warm White starts from a Kelvin temperatures of 2200 K to 3000 K. 4000 K to 5000 K is what to referred to as natural white and 5700 K to 6500 K as cool white. 

            Warm White is also called as Soft White and in India as Golden Yellow. As the name says it all the light is more yellow and resembles the early morning Sunrise or sunset color of the Sun. 
            
            As we move up to 4000 K - 5000 k  the light colour is less of yellow and more of white and from 5700 K to 6500 K , the LED bulb loses its yellowness and offers white light with a tinge of blue light. Blue light is 10000 K , where there is no whiteness at all.
            
            Warm white bulbs or LED fittings usually start at 2200 K ( which are usually not available in India) and goes upto 3000K . Most of the LED bulbs or Fittings which are easily available is 3000K  
            
            Natural white is often recommended by experts as the more preferred light temperature for work environment. 
            
            Natural white is less yellow and more white, but without the tinge of blue, so technically  this could be the best color for productivity . Nowadays most Commercial fittings work at light temperatures of 5700 K which loses its yellowness and with the faintest of blue tinge.
            
            6500 K will have a visible tinge of blue light 
            
            So which is the best light for different tasks have been explained above. Still we recommend that users experience the light and then buy a light which suits them more.
