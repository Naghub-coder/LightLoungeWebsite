            IP rating means Ingress protection rating. Is the  of protection of dust , water and accidental contact  an electrical fixture . all electrical fixtures will be given an IP rating like IP 20 , IP 44 etc
<br>
            Purely for the purpose of the residential requirement , the IP rating has to understood as mentioned below
            The first digit denotes protection against solids and the second digit against liquids. The first  digit which is protection against solids starts from 1 and goes upto 6. As the Number of first digit goes up from 1 to 6 , it means that the fixture is more strongly protected from ingress from tiny dust particles to fine dust . Similarly the second digit which is protection against liquid ranges from 0 ( which means Zero protection) upto 8 , which is a fitting which can work submerged under water.
            
            As a guiding factor
            <br>
            
            All indoor lights will have an IP rating of IP 20 
            All outdoor lights will have an IP rating ranging between IP44 to IP 68
            <br>
             Please note : Swimming pool lights or any lights which will be submerged in water will require an IP 67 or IP 68 rating . While choosing these  lights please take advice from the lighting company or lighting consultant on installation procedures.
