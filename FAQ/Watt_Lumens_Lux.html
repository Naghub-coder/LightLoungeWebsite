          </span> &nbsp;What is the connection between Wattages, Lumens and Lux?
          <br>
          <span style="font-size: 1rem;">
            The Earlier models had a very low LPW ( Lumen per watt ) , downlighters in 2014 were only having a brightness of 50 lumens per watt and were priced very highly . In the last few years , the LPW has gone up to 100 to 110 lumens and prices of branded downlighters have nose dived to very reasonable prices.
<br>
            What is important is lumens is what is relevant and not the wattage. Lumens is equal to Brightness and Wattage is equal to energy consumed. 
            
            <br>
            The amount of light that falls on a surface is called illuminance, which is measured in lux.  One lux is equal to one lumen per square meter (lux = lumens/m2) . For calculation of lux it is also important to take into account the height distance ( Floor to Gypsum Ceiling) 
            
            There are standards of Lux which are required based on the application. 
            <br>
            
            For Example a living room requires around 150 to 200 and so on . In commercial applications os Functional Work Areas require a lux levels of 300 to 500 Lux.
            
            So for a residence , take a decision on how much brightness you need  , by which you can calculate the LUX  required and then decide on the wattage and quantity  required. 
            
            <br>
            The downlighters starts at wattages of  3 W, 5W , & 7W, 10 W , 15 W , 18 W and 22 W.
            
            Many Electrical contractors recommend a  5 inch Cutout Downlighter or a 6 inch cutout .
            Remember LUX is vital and lights chosen accordingly. Dont decide a light by the cut out size or wattage.
