          </span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What are 2X2 Lights?<br>
          <span style="font-size: 1rem;">An office space usually is much larger than  residential spaces , so large office spaces need more efficient light at a pocket friendly prices. 

            For this purpose a light model called troffer had been developed. Originally troffer used to be a 2 feet square light with fluorescent lamps . Nowadays troffers are available in LED also. Similar to a downlighter most 2 x 2 lights are an aluminium or a plastic frame.
            
            2 x 2 are more brighter starting at 30 watts and go upto 42 watts in many models. Nowadays most troffers offer 120 lumens per watt brightness . Simply put more brightness at lower purchase cost and a lower  operational cost.
            
            Commercial spaces , decide on the lighting requirements , by the lux calculation.    Lux is the measure of illumination which falls on a surface.
            
            How much lux is needed for a working space is determined by the work nature. Lux for a work space in a software company is different from a manufacturing spaces. There are many guidelines as to how much lux is required for a specific space  . Based on the guideline , lux is calculated using softwares . The product and the quantity is calculated for the required lux. 
            
            All 2 x 2 led panels are designed for long life and interrupted continuous performance.
            
            Philips are pioneers in lighting technology and has many rugged workhorses Like RC360B , RC 380 B , RC 375B and many more models which outperform other brands by a mile.
