          </span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What are LED Panel Lights <br>
          <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Led panel lights are sometimes called downlighters. downlighters are any lights which are fixed to the ceiling and through light downwards. This could be any fitting which are fixed to the ceiling and the light being emitted could be from led panel or a fitting with a bulb . 

            In consumer parlance Downlighters have come to be identified with LED panels. These are essentially a metal frame which houses the lights and the diffuser. 
            Aluminium is the most preferred and commonly used metal and for more budget friendly models , PVC is also being used extensively.

<h3>LED downlighters are available in 2 styles </h3>
<br>

1.	Surface Downlighter - These are fixed to the true ceiling
2.	Recessed Downlighters - These are fixed to the False ceiling

As a standard most LED downlighters are available in wattages of 3,  5 , 10  12 , 15 , 18 and 22 .  

Normally for a residential purpose , medium level brightness is preferred by most consumers.
Typically in any Indian city , the height from floor to roof averages between 9 to 10 feet. Allowing 6 inches for the false ceiling gap , the effective height is only between 8.5 feet to 9.5 feet. So what is best downlighter to be fixed , is to be decided after taking the cubic volume of the room into consideration. 

For this , you need to know how much brightness is required . Any LED panel Downlighter has 2 important specifications , Wattage and Lumens.. Wattage is the measure of the power consumed , while lumens is the measure of brightness. 

So what you need for your house is how much brightness you require rather than how much wattage. 

With many downlighters today available at more lumens per watt it would be wise to choose a downlighter based on the brightness. 

Most Electricians today recommend a 15 watts downlighter as standard option. This may be too  bright if the consumers prefer lower brightness
