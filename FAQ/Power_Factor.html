          </span> &nbsp;What is Power Factor ? . How and why is it important ?<br>
          <span style="font-size: 1rem;">
            Power factor is the ratio of real power absorbed by the load to the apparent power flowing through the circuit.. Vow that was confusing is it. 
Let us make it simpler . 

Voltage x Current X PF = Watts
<br>

Let us take a  case of 10 Watts Downlighter . Here we know two values
<br>


W = 10 and Voltage = 230V . And for the moment let us assume PF  1 
<br>

Therefore

   10 = 230 X A ( Current ) x 1
So  Current ( A)  = 10/230 = .043 A 
<br>

Now what is the issue , you might think. Never is PF 1. Most LED lights are mentioned as pf > .9. Now is this bad.  not really any product with PF equal to or greater than .9 is a good buy. But if the PF was to drop to 0.5 then the story changes
<br>
Now have a look at the formula again 
<br>
KW ( Kilo Watts ) = Kilo Voltampere ( KVA ) x power factor

Now you electric meter reading is KVA and not KW 
<br>
So KVA = KW / Power Factor 

 Let us apply the formula Now for a downlighter of 10 Watts with a .5 pf
<br>
As seen above KVA = 10 / 0.5 which is 20 . 

Now if the power factor is 0.5 , even though you may think that you have a 10 watts downlighter , the actual consumption is double . This essentially means, if you have say 40 of LED lights at home , then you have purchased lights which consume 20 watts of power 
<br>
Take utmost care while buying LED products
